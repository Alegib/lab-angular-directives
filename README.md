<!-- ## Getting Started -->

## Instructions

Create a simple todo-list application using Angular. Your application must:

1. **Iteration 1** | Allow users to create new todos in the UI

2. **Iteration 2** | Allow users to mark todos as complete changing its color to green

3. **Iteration 3** | Allow users to mark todos as "postpone" which will temporarily remove them from the list

4. **Iteration 4** | Allow users to delete todos from the UI

5. **Iteration 5** | Add a clean button that will remove the completed todos

6. **Iteration 6** | Add a restore button that will bring back all the postponed todos

7. **Bonus** - **Iteration 7** | Add an edit option if you like or work on the styling
